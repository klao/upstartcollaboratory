# upstart
upstartcollaboratory.org's html code

In May 2024, David with Mihaly's tutoring/help, learned to strip the css elements from internet archive as well, and to use github to host. 
Currently, upstartcollaboratory.org and its pages are hosted on github

<li> Upstart website got an error msg August 2023: "Error establishing a database connection"
<li> David is learning how to resolve this. 
<li> He renewed the domain, because namesilo prompted me to, even though he thought he renewed a few months ago.
<li> He added hosting on namesilo, and then learned more about hosting such that he believes surely this is hosted somewhere already. He doesn't know where that is.
<li> He looked into different ways to resolve the error message, and it seems he needs to check the database files(?) and make sure different things are correctly pointed at each other, only to discover new hosting service has empty public_html files. He's worried how this may conflict with a pre-existing hosting, and also of possible lost of old data.
<li> He decides it's a good idea to back up the html files at least from wayback machine and learn to use github as a repo, because it's a longgg time coming anyways.

<li> Each file is a copy of the html stripped from wayback machine (but removing the wayback machine elements)
